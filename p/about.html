        <h3>SAP&mdash;Design Program Manager Intern</h3>
        <h3>06/2021 &mdash; 10/2021</h4>
        <div class="hidden-content">
            <!-- Additional content can be placed here -->
            <p>
                At SAP, I managed a wide scope of work for over 90 members in a global UX Organization. To sum it up, Design Program Management is a mix of:
                    <li>40% Program Management</li>
                    <li>40% Project Management</li>
                    <li>20% Product Management</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                Design program management is a specialized form of program management that focuses on managing the design and development of products or services.
                 Often times, this takes on the form of large program initiatives, but in addition to regular project management activities
                  which support the regular delivery intervals of UX design deliveries. This would come in the form of maintaining
                  user stories and roadmaps by working with the design team, and ensuring project management practices are upheld.
            </p>
            <p> Essentially, Design Program Managers handle program initiatives in addition to the project management activities for the teams they are supporting, similar to a Technical Program Manager. </p>
            <p> Some notable highlights include:
                    <li>Delivered a UX Design Template, which resulted in an average of a 15% increase in UX Design Project Efficiency</li>
                    <li>Worked cross-functionally with Engineering and Product Management to streamline inefficiencies</li>
                    <li>Established new Agile Project Management practices spanning across the entire organization</li>

                VAS is an agri-tech company that provides dairy production software to help dairy farmers maximize their

                  of a Senior Project Manager.
            </p>
            <p> Some notable highlights include:
                    <li>Onboarding all customers and maintaining a 27% adoption rate of the site through marketing and engagement incentives</li>
                    <li>Maintained project timelines and shepherded the development process through Agile practices and ceremonies</li>
