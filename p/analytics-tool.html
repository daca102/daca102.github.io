        </div>
        <div class="textcontainer-right">

            <p>You are a Research Project Manager responsible for managing a playtest/user research session with the goal of collecting feedback 
                about an upcoming feature. Your objective is to understand how players precisely feel about the feature, and the
                 most effective way to achieve this is by reaching out to current players interested in beta testing unreleased features.
                  The current process involves obtaining a list of playerIDs, which they insert into another
                  tool which will then email players if they 
                  may be interested in trying this up and coming feature, while also being compensated for their time.</p>
            
            <p>However, the only way you can access the list of playerIDs is by contacting the analytics team and scheduling a 
                meeting with them to describe your demographics so that they can execute an SQL query 
                on the database to access this information.</p>
            

            <p>For the analytics team, they provide support for over 20 other game titles, each of which has 
                its own Research Project Managers responsible for conducting their playtest and user research sessions. 
                Currently, writing SQL queries to generate playerIDs
                is considered a necessary, albeit less preferred, reocurring task for the analytics team in the current
                working process for the company. The team would prefer to spend their resources on generating impactful
                insights from data.

        <h1>1. Research Methodology & Solution Development</h1>
        <p>
        We worked closely with 4 Project Managers and 2 members from the analytics team when developing a prototype design.
        Our development process proceeded as follows:

        <li>
            Exploratory Interviews with Project Managers to understand the specific use cases
        </li>
        <li>
            Lo-fi Mockup
        </li>    
        
        <li>
           Internal testing and critique with analytics team
        </li>    
        
        <li>
            Hi-fi Prototype Design v1
        </li>    
        
        <li>
            Internal testing and critique with analytics team round 2
    
        </li>

            Hi-fi Prototype Design v3
        </li>  
          
        </p>
    



    
    <h1>2. Personas</h1>
    <p>
From working with our stakeholders, we identified two primary personas that are directly affected by this inefficiency. 
As a group, we decided that the best way forward was to develop a self-service interface for project managers to use.
</p>


        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../images/analytics-tool-personaA.png" alt="Image Description" class="img-responsiveport">
        </div>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../images/analytics-tool-personaB.png" alt="Image Description" class="img-responsiveport">
        </div>


    <h1>3. Top 3 Research Findings</h1>
    <p>
        1. Most playerid data requests can be loosely summarized as 70% basic, 20% intermediate, and 10% advanced complexity
        of demographics. Project Managers have estimated that this self-service tool can cover a majority
         of the basic and intermediate requests (between 70-90% of all data requests).
         <li>            Basic requests tend to contain common variables and inclusions. I.e. <br> 
                (Game="Some_Game_Name" AND Country="United States" AND GameTime>500hours AND Level>100)
        </li>

        <li>            Intermediate queries tend to include many exclusions and OR states<br>

                (Game = 'Some_Game_Name' AND Country = 'Canada' AND GameTime > 500 AND Level > 100) or<BR>
                (Game = 'Some_Game_Name' AND Country = 'United States' AND City NOT IN ('NewYork', 'Dallas',
                 'Chicago', 'NewOrleans', 'Boston')
                AND GameTime > 500 AND Level > 100);
         </li>  

    <p>
        2. There are deadlines and time constraints for when a playtest/user research session occurs. So, 
        Research Project Managers may selectively decide and request for a less-than-ideal player demographic because they
        know what to expect from it. The risk of generating a bad-sample size can be catastrophic due to turnaround times.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       3.  Most playerID data requests are very basic and can be specified within the following parameters of
        Game, Language, Location, Playtime, and some unique variables (e.g., game modes).
    </p>

    <h1>
       4. Requirements
    </h1>

    <p>
    From the interviews conducted with several employees, we created a list of basic requirements as shown below.
    </p>

    <div class="img-container">
    <img src="../images/analytics-tool-requirements.png" alt="Image Description" class="img-responsiveport">
    </div>

<h1>
   5. Benefits
</h1>
<li>
    Decreasing PlayerID retrieval turnaround times from more than 7 days to less than 1 day
</li>
<li>
    Low Estimate of Saving $72,000/year from this one task.<br>
    (Per Year: 30Game titles X 6 research projects per Gametitle X 3 hours per request x $150/hour= $72,000)
</li>
<li>
    Allows for greater flexibility for Project Managers in terms of selecting player demographics and general timelines 
</li>

<div class="img-container">
    <img src="../images/comparison.png" alt="Image Description" class="img-responsiveport">
</div>


<h1>6. Reflections & Takeaways</h1>

<p>
    If we had a few more months to work on this, I am confident that we could have translated the designs into code,
    and built a fully functional product. With the solution we proposed, we expect to
    reduce turnaround times, save an estimated $72,000 annually, and give 
    Project Managers more flexibility in selecting player demographics.
</p>
    <p>
    But what truly resonates with me is not what we managed to come up with, but rather the transformation I witnessed in our team members. 
    We evolved into adept problem solvers and enthusiastic self-learners, and that growth was genuinely inspiring.
</p>
<p>
    As I reflect on this journey, I realize it wasn't just a professional endeavor; it was 
    a personal one as well. It taught me the vital importance of truly understanding user needs, 
    mastering the art of crafting user-friendly solutions, and experiencing the empowering effect of self-service tools.
</p>

<p>
    This experience isn't just a project; it's a living testament to the incredible potential that technology has when 
    we create solutions with it. It reaffirms my belief in the profound
     impact of continuous learning, especially in the ever-evolving landscape of tech.
