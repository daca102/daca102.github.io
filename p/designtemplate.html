            <h2>
                This was my first project at SAP as part of my ongoing goal to optimize
                the UX Design Process as a Design Program Manager. I delivered a Figma Design
                Template that was standardized for its usage across the entire UX organization.

                        UX Designers vary greatly in terms of their design process, and there were no
                        organizational standard at the time

                    <li>
                        UX Designers often started a design project from a blank canvas, and it took time 
                        to setup the specific project settings for each new design file.

            <p>You are a UX Designer and you're assigned to start work on a new Design Project. Typically, You start from a blank
                page in Figma, and you start structuring your design file to ensure that things are in order. For example,
                fonts, color schemes, design systems, and structuring your page names. This takes time.
            </p>

            <p>    Afterwards, you finally start your design project, and start designing things. 
                Every Designer has a slightly different design process, and it becomes a bigger
                problem when you need to collaborate with other UX Designers. So, you need to agree
                on the exact process you are going to take. This takes time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               From an organizational standpoint, this becomes difficult to view the design projects in Figma
               as there is no consistency in place across all Designers. 
               
               There is also a lot of duplicated
               efforts spent in establishing a new UX Design project each time.

                    <li>
                    Reduce duplicated efforts in starting a new Design Project?

                    <li>
                    Ensure UX Designers are following a structured Design Approach?
                    </li>



<h1>1. Communicating the Vision</h1>
<p>
    To generate anticipation and excitement, I sent emails to all our designers, outlining a clear and 
    compelling vision for the new project I was leading that would improve and standardize our Design Processes in Figma. I 
    explained how the proposed Figma template would revolutionize our workflow, 
    streamline processes, and enhance the quality of our designs. I also requested their future assistance in its development, 
    and the purpose of this was to gain early buy-in and let UX Designers know that this would be a collaborative effort.
</p>

<h1>2. Initial Interviews</h1>
        <p>
            To kickstart this change, I began by conducting several open ended 1 on 1 interviews with UX designers to understand their 
            design process and the challenges they faced. I discovered issues like design inconsistencies, 
            project delays, and the frustration of designers dealing with repetitive tasks involved with starting a new UX Design
            project. From this, I received many actionable insights on what it should contain, and as well as what 
            processes should be embedded in it. We proceeded to base the template structure upon The Double Diamond Design Process model.
            It is a design thinking method which follows 4 stages, Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver.
        </p>
    

<h1>3. Development</h1>
        <p>
            From the initial interviews, I started developing a prototype version on the general structure and flow for the template from scratch.
            I often asked and received help from enthusiastic UX Designers on how to create certain assets on the Figma environment. During
            the early development process, I conducted quick 1 on 1 feedback sessions with 3 UX Designers such that I could quickly iterate
            and improve the Design Template.
        </p>

<div class="portfoliomargins">

<h1>4. User Testing</h1>
        <p>
            When the Design Template started looking fairly polished, I conducted 2 intensive rounds of user testing with over
            12 UX Designers. The purpose was to gather qualitative and quantitative data regarding the template and make modifications
            based upon it. For example, I would provide them scenario workflows and I would record how long they took a certain action.
            Afterwards, I would then ask them follow-up questions on that specific workflow for what they would normally do instead.
            With this information, I was able to further optimize the Design Template.
        
        </p>

<h1>5. Beta Testing</h1>
    <p>
        After fine-tuning the Design Template after the User Testing, I initiated a Beta Testing stage and invited
        around 13 UX Designers who I previously showed the template to try it out for a 4 week period and to provide feedback.

        After a 4 week period, I had a follow-up 1 on 1 meeting with each of them and they were able to share many insights that I merged into 
        a final copy of the Design Template. 

        
    </p>

<h1>6. Launch</h1>
    <p>Due to our strategic actions early in the process of building excitement for the Design Template, many UX Designers expressed 
        eagerness to utilize it. Unintentionally, several UX Designers from the beta test group, who had initial access to the Design
         Template, generously shared it with their colleagues on the team. As a result, by the official launch date, a substantial
          number of UX Designers had already gained access to it. I believe the adoption process proceeded smoothly due to the open 
          communication early on, discussing the adoption of the Design Template, and the collaborative efforts involved in its
           development with Designers from various teams.
        
    </p>



<h1>7. Reflections & Takeaways</h1>
    <p>
        This was a good starting project for me because I spent a good portion of time learning about Figma and how to use it.
        I gained empathy for UX Designers and what they did by learning how to use the same tools they used, and I am proud to say I 
        know most of Figma in-and-out at this point.
