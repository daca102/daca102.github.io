            <h1>SAP &mdash; Optimizing Project Management for UX Design </h1>
            <h2>
                Drawing upon my expertise in UX Design processes gained during my initial project at SAP, 
                I played a pivotal role in spearheading a new initiative aimed at enhancing Project Management efficiency for a UX 
                organization. 
                This initiative was implemented for 90+ UX Designers within a well-established UX Design 
                organization, and I collaborated closely with a seasoned Senior PM throughout the process.

                   <p>
                    In the last 5 years, the SAP BTP software development organization has witnessed rapid expansion,
                     resulting in a substantial increase in the number of UX design projects and teams. While the overall development
                      organization has adopted the SAFe project management framework, the Design organization's project management 
                      practices have remained static. This misalignment between our organization's growth and the absence of 
                      updated project management processes has given rise to several critical challenges, including inefficiencies 
                      in project execution, suboptimal resource allocation, breakdowns in communication, and difficulties in prioritizing
                     Design backlog items.

                The VAS Community was designed to serve as an all-inclusive help website where customers can access articles,
                 engage in discussions with other farmers on forums, and seek customer support through live chats. As time passed,
                  the objective was to encourage customers to use this service more frequently than contacting the customer support, 
                  as it proved to be a more cost-effective option.
