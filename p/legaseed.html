            <h2>
                For my undergraduate product management class, we worked with an early stage startup to
                establish a product direction. Legaseed aims to be a service that can provide a digital legacy
                for one's life after their passing.

                You are 74 years old, and you know that your time is coming to an end soon.

                You have a daughter who is 45 years old with her own family living in the city, while you remain in the suburbs.
                The only time you do see her and your children is during the holidays. Your daughter cherishes you, and you regularly
                keep in touch with her and have conversations over the phone.
                You treasure your family and your friends, and you have a desire to leave a memory of who you were when you pass away.
                There are stories that you have never had the chance to tell, because the timing and situation has never been right.
                But, those were the ones that defined who you were.

        <h1>1. User Interviews</h1>
    <p>We conducted conversational interviews for 8 people belonging to the 65+ year old demographic and 8 people between 40-65.
 We asked them open-ended questions regarding family dynamics, and how important stories were. 
    </p>

    <p><b>
        Some interesting common findings we found from the 65+ year old category were:</b>
        <li>
          that they like to share their personal stories
        </li>

        <li>
            they have stated similar statements along the lines that "I need to pick and choose which
            stories to tell" because their grandchildren are too young and may not understand it
        </li>
        
        
        <li>
            They value their family and what they think of them even after they pass away    
        </li>
    </p>

    <p><b>
        Some interesting findings we found from the 40-65 year old category were:</b>
        <li>
           Those that have experienced death in the families, they wish they had a more tangible piece of their loved ones
        </li>
        <li>
            They wish they knew more about the their grandparent's life stories and who they were
        </li>

        <li>
            They appreciate the value of imparting life stories, especially those from their grandparents and parents
        </li>
    </p>
    

<p><b>
    At the very end, we introduced them to this service, and asked them if it was something they were interested in, and if they 
    would pay for it.</b>

    We found that:

    <li>
        A majority of our interviewees would pay for it, and many of them compared this to a memorial photo album
    </li>

    <li>
        There would be some difficulty in having the eldery user setting it up because technology is hard, and they would
        require a helping hand in digitalizing their lifestories. It would also feel awkward to be speaking about
        the story alone, and it needs to  be a 2-way dialogue.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Many of the surveyed 40-65 year olds have indicated that they would be willing to help set this up
    </li>
</p>

    <h1>2. Personas</h1>
    <p>
        From our research, We devised two personas at the beginning which we will be referring to as the Champion and User Persona.
        The Champion Persona is the one who will champion for and argue for its usage of the product. The User Persona
        is the one who sees value and will be the one directly using it.

<h1>3. User Stories</h1>
<p>From our user interviews, we have found that technology is a barrier, and it would require work from both the Champion and User
    Persona in order to establish a digitalized repository. This repository will act akin to a memorial album but with
    videos of the person sharing their life stories. The user stories below describe the minimum functionalities required
 such that the Champion Persona can interview the User Persona for lifestories and view it afterwards.

        <h1>4. Lo-Fi Wireframe</h1>

        <p>
            We created a wireframe based upon the research and user stories as shown below.
        </p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../images/legaseed-wireframe.png" alt="Image Description" class="img-responsive2">
        </div>



<h1>5. Is there a market for this? </h1>


<p>
    Probably! As a comparable, Shutterfly sells physical photobooks with a wide range between $30-$100 each but not
    specific towards any niche. 
</p>

<p>
    We also conducted a short online survey (sample size = 210) asking if
    they may be interested in potentially purchasing a digital photo album that can digitalize their parents' videos and photos. 
    <li>  57% of the people stated that they would be interested in a product like this.
    </li>
    <li>
        Of the 57% (120 people), we asked them "What is the maximum price they might pay for this service? on a reocurring basis?" with several options
        which were $0.99/month, $1.99/month, $2.99/month and $3.99, and other. Our data showed that 78% (93/120)  
        were willing to spend more than more than $2.99/month.

    </li>
</p>
<p>
    From the survey results, we have found that there is definitely a market for this, and further price experimentation is required
    to understand the consumers willingness-to-pay.
    </p>


<h1>6. Marketing</h1>


    <p>

        To ensure the success of Legaseed, it's imperative that both the Champion and User personas express interest in our service.

   To address this, we propose a two-pronged marketing approach when trying to invite users to the platform.
   </p>
       
   <p>        User-Centric Strategy: Our first strategy focuses on the users. We plan to collaborate with channel partners 
    to raise awareness about Legaseed. This involves hosting live group sessions to introduce potential end-users to the product
     and distributing informative brochures. We will target locations like Retirement and Assisted Living homes, hospitals,
      terminal illness support groups, and senior travel groups.
      
    
   </p>

   <p>     Champion-Centric Strategy: Our second strategy targets the Champion persona. We will leverage digital video
     ads on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and Pinterest. Our ads will be tailored to resonate with women
      aged 40-65 residing in areas with higher household incomes. The messaging will emphasize the importance of passing down
       family stories to their children. We'll also explore opportunities to feature in newsletters sent by our channel partners
        to the Champion.
    </p>
    <p>
        By implementing this two-pronged marketing and sales approach, we aim to educate both our User and Champion 
        personas about Legaseed, fostering a greater likelihood of product adoption.
    </p>

<h1>7. Reflections & Takeaways</h1>

<p>


    Reflecting on this project from a product management perspective, I've gained valuable insights into the
     intricacies and responsibilities that come with developing 0-1 products. Here are some key takeaways:
</p>

<p>
    Research played a pivotal role in shaping our product strategy. Market research helped us understand 
    the video legacy market niche and identify potential gaps and competitors. User research involved interviews
     and surveys, enabling us to empathize with our users' frustrations and needs. This phase underscored the i
     mportance of data-driven decision-making and the power of user insights in product development.

    </p> 

     <p>
        MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
      Creating an MVP was a strategic approach that resonated with me. It allowed us to build a product with essential
       features while leaving room for iteration based on user feedback. The MVP features, such as story sharing and 
       question prompts, demonstrated the practical application of this concept. It reinforced the idea that a product
        doesn't need to be perfect from the start but should address core user needs.    
     </p>
    

    <p>
    Go-To-Market Strategy: The go-to-market plan outlined in the project highlights the significance of tailoring marketing 
    and sales strategies to different user personas, and how multiple marketing strategies are often in place simultaneously.
